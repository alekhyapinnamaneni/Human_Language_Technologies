## Overview of NLP

This [document](./0-Overview_of_NLP/Overview_of_NLP.pdf) contains a brief introduction to natural language processing and its relevant related concepts.

## Portfolio 1: Text Processing with Python

This [program](./1-Text_Processing_with_Python/Text_Processing.py) reads from a [file](./1-Text_Processing_with_Python/data.csv) containing data about employees, processes and modifies the data using regex, and outputs each employee's information. To learn more about this program, please read this [document](./1-Text_Processing_with_Python/Overview.pdf).

## Portfolio 2: Word Guessing Game
This [program](./2-Word_Guessing_Game/Word_Guessing_Game.py) processes [raw text](./2-Word_Guessing_Game/anat19.txt), and extracts tokens and nouns from the text, and simulates a word guessing game using words from the text.

## Portfolio 3: WordNet
This [pdf](./3-WordNet/WordNet.pdf) contains a python notebook that explores various areas of WordNet, including synsets, hierarchy, morphy, similarity algorithms, SentiWordNet, and collocations.

## Portfolio 4: N-grams
This program plays around with using N-grams to classify text. The [first program](./4-Ngrams/Ngrams_Part1.py) extracts unigrams and bigrams from three texts written in three different languages (English, French, Italian). The [second program](./4-Ngrams/Ngrams_Part2.py) uses the unigrams and bigrams to create a probabilistic language model and classify lines of text into three categories based on the language. Additionally, this [document](./4-Ngrams/Narrative.pdf) contains useful information on N-grams and how they are used in natural language processing.

## Portfolio 5: Sentence Parsing
This [document](./5-Sentence_Parsing/Sentence_Parsing.pdf) implements different methods of parsing on a sample sentence.

## Portfolio 6: Building a Corpus
This [program](./6-Building_A_Corpus/Webcrawler.py) implements a webcrawler and webscraping to build a knowledge base/corpus.

## Portfolio 7: Text Classification
This [document](./7-Text_Classification/Text_Classification.pdf) implements text classification on a [dataset](./7-Text_Classification/emails.csv) using 3 methods: naive Bayes, logistc regression, and neural networks. 

## Portfolio 8: Reading ACL Papers
This [document](./8-ACL_Paper/ACL_Paper.pdf) contains a summary of a paper studying multi-party empathetic dialogue from the 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics conference.

## Portfolio 9: Chatbot Project
This [program](./9-Chatbot/Chatbot.py) contains an implementation of a simple chatbot that speaks to the user in Shakespearean English using dialogue from Hamlet as its knowledge base. See this [report](./9-Chatbot/Report.pdf) to learn more about how the chatbot works.

## Portfolio 10: Text Classification 2
This [documeny](./10-Text_Classification_2/hi.txt) implements text classification on a [dataset](./10-Text_Classification_2/hi.txt) using multiple deep learning model variations and embeddings.
